# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Real-Time Analytics Platform.

## API Authentication

All data ingestion API endpoints are protected with API key authentication:
- Authentication is implemented using the `X-API-Key` header
- Valid API keys are managed via configuration
- Unauthorized requests are rejected with 401 status

To use the API, include a valid API key in your requests:

```bash
# When accessing the API locally through port-forwarding
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-key-1" \
  -d '{"device_id": "test-001", "temperature": 25.5, "humidity": 60}'

# When accessing through the Kubernetes cluster
curl -X POST http://<cluster-ip>/api/data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-key-1" \
  -d '{"device_id": "test-001", "temperature": 25.5, "humidity": 60}'
```

## Current Security Features

- **API Authentication**: API key required for data ingestion endpoints
- **Container Security**: Non-root users, dropped capabilities, read-only filesystem
- **Network Policies**: Default deny with explicit allow rules for internal communication
- **Resource Limits**: All containers have CPU and memory limits to prevent DoS

## For Production Deployments

1. **TLS Configuration**:
   - Enable TLS for Kafka communication
   - Use proper TLS certificates for all API endpoints

2. **Enhanced Authentication**:
   - Implement OAuth or JWT-based authentication
   - Use a proper identity provider for user management

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use a dedicated secrets management service (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Rotate credentials regularly
   - Enable encryption-at-rest for all Kubernetes secrets

4. **Additional Security Measures**:
   - Implement pod security policies
   - Enable audit logging
   - Set up regular security scanning of container images
   - Implement runtime threat detection

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it by sending an email to (yuuliu03@gmail.com).

## 6. Next Steps for Further Security Hardening

You've made great progress with the security enhancements. Consider these next steps:

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to protect against potential DoS attacks
2. **Add TLS for Kafka**: Enable TLS encryption for Kafka connections
3. **Secret Management**: Move API keys to Kubernetes secrets
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Add alerting for suspicious activity
5. **Regular Security Scanning**: Implement regular vulnerability scans of the platform

## Summary

Your platform now has these key security measures in place:
- **✅ Authentication**: API key authentication for the data ingestion endpoints
- **✅ Network Policy**: Default deny policy with explicit allow rules
- **✅ Documentation**: Security measures are well-documented
- **✅ Container Security**: Non-root users, minimal capabilities, resource limits
- **✅ Logging**: All security events are properly logged

These changes have significantly improved the security posture of your real-time analytics platform while maintaining all of its functionality. Well done!
