```bash
# View pod statuses
./manage.sh pods

# View logs for a specific pod
./manage.sh logs <pod-name>

# Get detailed information about a pod
./manage.sh describe <pod-name>

# Restart a specific deployment
./manage.sh restart <deployment-name>

# Restart all deployments
./manage.sh restart-all

# Start minikube tunnel for LoadBalancer services
./manage.sh tunnel-start

# Stop minikube tunnel
./manage.sh tunnel-stop
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the deployment, try the following:

### Complete Reset

If you need to start from scratch:

```bash
# Complete cleanup and reset
./manage.sh reset-all

# Then run setup again
./manage.sh setup-all
```

### Storage Layer Issues

If you encounter issues with the storage layer component:

```bash
# Fix the storage layer specifically
./manage.sh fix-storage
```

### Kafka Timing Out

If Kafka is taking too long to deploy or fails:

```bash
# Reset the full environment
./manage.sh reset-all

# Deploy with the updated configuration
./manage.sh setup-all
```

To check Kafka logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n analytics-platform -l app=kafka
```

## Monitoring Setup

The platform includes a comprehensive monitoring stack:

### Prometheus
- Collects metrics from all services
- Exposes metrics via HTTP API
- Used for alerting and monitoring

### Grafana
- Provides visualization of metrics
- Pre-configured dashboards
- Connects to Prometheus data source
- Custom alert thresholds

To setup a Grafana dashboard:
1. Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Login with credentials from: ./scripts/setup-secrets.sh
3. Go to Dashboards → New Dashboard
4. Add a new panel
5. Select Prometheus as the data source
6. Query examples:
   - `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` - Request rate
   - `process_resident_memory_bytes` - Memory usage
   - `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))` - 95th percentile latency

## Platform Security Features

- For local development, set `imagePullPolicy: Never` in the deployment files
- Some services require persistent storage - ensure PVCs are properly created
- Grafana may take up to 60 seconds to become ready due to strict readiness probe settings

## Security Recommendations for Production

This repository contains a demo/development setup. Before deploying to production, consider these security enhancements:

1. **Secret Management**:
   - Replace base64-encoded secrets with a proper secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Use Kubernetes External Secrets or Sealed Secrets for GitOps workflows
   - Rotate secrets regularly using automated processes

2. **Container Security**:
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Snyk
   - Use minimal base images like distroless or alpine
   - Implement Pod Security Standards at the Restricted level
   - Consider using OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno for policy enforcement

3. **Network Security**:
   - Implement service mesh (Istio or Linkerd) for mTLS between services
   - Use NetworkPolicies to restrict communication between components
   - Add proper Ingress with TLS termination

4. **Authentication & Access Control**:
   - Implement proper OIDC authentication for external access
   - Use cert-manager for certificate management
   - Define proper RBAC roles with least privilege principle

5. **Monitoring & Compliance**:
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Implement audit logging
   - Deploy a SIEM solution for security monitoring

Run `./scripts/security-check.sh` regularly to validate your security posture.
