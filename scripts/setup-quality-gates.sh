- Add 8-stage quality gates workflow with code quality, testing, security
- Include integration tests with build tags for data-ingestion and clean-ingestion services  
- Add OpenAPI documentation for data ingestion and clean ingestion APIs
- Configure performance baselines for development/CI environment
- Add branch protection setup script with CODEOWNERS configuration
- Include comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting guide

Quality gates include:
- Code quality & linting with golangci-lint and staticcheck
- Unit tests with 60% coverage requirement
- Security analysis with gosec, truffleHog, and custom security checks
- Docker builds with Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Integration tests with Kafka dependencies
- Performance benchmarking with regression detection
- Documentation validation for APIs and Kubernetes manifests
- Final quality gate that blocks merge on critical failures" || true
