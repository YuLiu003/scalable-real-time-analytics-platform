# Docker Hub Integration Setup

## Overview

The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline supports optional Docker Hub integration for pushing built images. If Docker Hub credentials are not configured, the pipeline will still build images locally for testing and validation.

## Current Behavior

### ‚úÖ **Without Docker Hub Credentials** (Current Setup)
- ‚úÖ Docker images are built locally
- ‚úÖ Images are tested and validated
- ‚úÖ Vulnerability scanning runs on local images
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Images are **not pushed** to Docker Hub
- ‚úÖ CI pipeline continues and passes

### üöÄ **With Docker Hub Credentials** (Optional Enhancement)
- ‚úÖ All the above features +
- ‚úÖ Images are pushed to Docker Hub
- ‚úÖ Images are available for deployment
- ‚úÖ Tagged with branch names and commit SHAs

## Setting Up Docker Hub Integration (Optional)

### Step 1: Create Docker Hub Account
1. Go to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Create repositories for each service:
   - `your-username/data-ingestion-go`
   - `your-username/clean-ingestion-go`
   - `your-username/processing-engine-go`
   - `your-username/storage-layer-go`
   - `your-username/visualization-go`
   - `your-username/tenant-management-go`

### Step 2: Generate Access Token
1. Go to Docker Hub ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Security
2. Click "New Access Token"
3. Name: `github-actions-ci`
4. Permissions: `Read, Write, Delete`
5. Copy the generated token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 3: Add GitHub Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Add two new repository secrets:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME = your-dockerhub-username
DOCKER_PASSWORD = your-access-token-from-step-2
```

### Step 4: Verify Setup
1. Push a change to trigger the CI pipeline
2. Check the Actions tab
3. Look for "‚úÖ Docker image built and pushed" messages

## Image Naming Convention

When Docker Hub is configured, images are tagged as:
```
your-username/service-name:branch-name
your-username/service-name:commit-sha
your-username/service-name:latest
```

Examples:
```
yuliu/data-ingestion-go:main
yuliu/data-ingestion-go:55a8b05
yuliu/data-ingestion-go:latest
```

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ **Secure Practices Used**
- Access tokens (not passwords) for authentication
- Repository secrets (encrypted) for credential storage
- Limited scope access tokens
- Automatic credential validation in CI

### üîê **Access Token Permissions**
- Use minimal required permissions
- Rotate tokens regularly (every 6-12 months)
- Revoke tokens if compromised

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ‚ùå "unauthorized: incorrect username or password"
**Solution**: Check that GitHub secrets are correctly set:
- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username (not email)
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your access token (not account password)

#### ‚ùå "repository does not exist"
**Solution**: Create repositories in Docker Hub first:
1. Go to Docker Hub
2. Click "Create Repository"
3. Name it exactly as your service name (e.g., `data-ingestion-go`)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è "Docker image built but NOT pushed"
**Solution**: This is expected when Docker Hub credentials are not configured. This is not an error.

### Verification Commands

Check if secrets are set (from GitHub Actions):
```bash
# This will show "true" or "false" without revealing the actual values
echo "Docker username set: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME != '' }}"
echo "Docker password set: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD != '' }}"
```

## Current CI Pipeline Status

| Service | Build Status | Push Status |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| data-ingestion-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |
| clean-ingestion-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |
| processing-engine-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |
| storage-layer-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |
| visualization-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |
| tenant-management-go | ‚úÖ Local Build | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Push (No Docker Hub) |

## Alternative: Using GitHub Container Registry

Instead of Docker Hub, you can use GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):

### Benefits
- No additional account needed
- Integrated with GitHub permissions
- Unlimited public repositories

### Setup
1. Add this to your workflow instead of Docker Hub login:
```yaml
- name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
  uses: docker/login-action@v2
  with:
    registry: ghcr.io
    username: ${{ github.actor }}
    password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

2. Update image names to use `ghcr.io/username/repo/service:tag`

## Summary

The current setup is **production-ready** without Docker Hub. Adding Docker Hub credentials is optional and only needed if you want to:
- Share images publicly
- Deploy from external systems
- Use images in other projects

The CI pipeline will work perfectly without Docker Hub credentials and will clearly indicate when images are built locally vs. pushed to a registry.
